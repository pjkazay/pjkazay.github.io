So I've got some good stuff going on replit and have taken it a bit further. I have added and differentiated 2 different versions of posts. One is "job" whch rolls into a job history section on the homepage w specific display cards. But I've also added a new section called "The Work" as a top level menu with the tag "work."I Want to find some kind of simple widget to display links or a blogroll or posts. Are there modules like that - ones that can detect a certain tagged type of post in a jekyll site and display them in snug rows with a short text preview & date?Not a new problem so I'm curious if this widget is something w many prebuilt options in the jekyll communityEditYes! You're describing a very common Jekyll pattern and there are several built-in and community solutions:
Built-in Jekyll approaches:
1. Simple post loop with filtering:
liquid{% for post in site.posts %}
  {% if post.tags contains 'work' %}
    <div class="post-card">
      <h3><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h3>
      <p class="date">{{ post.date | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}</p>
      <p class="excerpt">{{ post.excerpt | strip_html | truncatewords: 25 }}</p>
    </div>
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
2. Jekyll collections (more structured):
Create a _work collection in _config.yml:
yamlcollections:
  work:
    output: true
    permalink: /:collection/:name/
Popular Jekyll plugins/widgets:
Jekyll-Archives - automatic tag/category pages
Jekyll-Paginate-V2 - advanced pagination with filtering
Jekyll-Feed - RSS feeds for specific tags
Community themes with built-in post grids:

Minimal Mistakes - has archive layouts and post grids
Beautiful Jekyll - includes post previews
Academic Pages - portfolio-focused layouts

CSS Grid/Flexbox layouts:
Most themes use CSS Grid or Flexbox for the card layouts. You can usually find examples in:

_layouts/archive.html
_includes/post-card.html
_sass/ files

For your "The Work" section specifically:
Since you already have the tagging working, you probably just need to create a layout template that filters by the "work" tag and displays them in a grid. The Zolan theme might already have similar layouts you can copy and modify.
Want me to help you build a custom post grid for your "work" tagged posts?
