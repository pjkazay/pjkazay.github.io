As a Product Manager at a fast-growing startup, I faced one of the most challenging aspects of the role: explaining complex product roadmaps to stakeholders who didn't live and breathe product strategy every day. That's when I discovered the power of explaining things as if I were talking to a 6-year-old.

## The Challenge

Product roadmaps are inherently complex. They involve:
- Multiple feature dependencies
- Resource allocation decisions
- Market timing considerations
- Technical constraints
- Business priorities that shift like sand dunes

When presenting to executives, engineers, sales teams, and customers, I noticed glazed-over expressions and nodding heads that clearly didn't understand the nuances of what we were building and why.

## The Breakthrough

The turning point came during a particularly tense stakeholder meeting. Our CEO asked why we couldn't just "add that feature quickly" to close a big deal. Instead of diving into technical debt, sprint capacity, and architectural considerations, I tried something different.

"Imagine we're building a house," I said. "You're asking us to add a second floor, but we haven't finished the foundation yet. Sure, we could try to build it, but the whole house might fall down."

The room went quiet. Then our CEO smiled and said, "Oh, now I get it. What do we need to finish the foundation first?"

## The Framework

From that moment, I developed what I call the "6-Year-Old Framework" for product communication:

### 1. Use Concrete Analogies
Instead of talking about "user journeys," I talked about "the path someone takes through our product, like following breadcrumbs through a forest."

### 2. Focus on the "Why"
Six-year-olds ask "why" constantly. So should stakeholders. I made sure every roadmap item clearly explained the problem we were solving, not just the solution we were building.

### 3. Visual Storytelling
Children learn through pictures and stories. I replaced Gantt charts with visual narratives showing how features connected and built upon each other.

### 4. Simple Language
If I couldn't explain a feature without jargon, I didn't understand it well enough myself. This forced me to think more clearly about what we were actually building.

## The Results

This approach transformed how our team communicated:

- **Stakeholder Buy-In**: Executives understood our priorities and stopped questioning every timeline
- **Team Alignment**: Engineers and designers could better understand the bigger picture
- **Customer Clarity**: Sales could explain our roadmap to customers in terms they actually cared about
- **Better Decisions**: Simplifying complex ideas helped us identify flawed assumptions

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Complexity is Often Unnecessary**: Most product decisions can be explained simply if you truly understand them
2. **Analogies Are Powerful**: They help people connect new concepts to familiar experiences
3. **Questions Reveal Understanding**: If someone can't ask good questions about your roadmap, they don't understand it
4. **Simplicity Scales**: A roadmap a 6-year-old could understand is one that scales across all your stakeholders

## The Lasting Impact

This communication style became my signature as a Product Manager. It helped me:
- Build stronger relationships with stakeholders
- Make better product decisions through clearer thinking
- Create more alignment across cross-functional teams
- Develop products that actually solved real problems

The best product managers aren't just strategic thinkersâ€”they're translators who can make the complex simple and the abstract concrete. Sometimes, the most sophisticated approach is to explain things like you're talking to a 6-year-old.

Because if a 6-year-old can understand your product strategy, so can everyone else who matters.
